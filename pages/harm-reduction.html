                <h2>Understanding Harm Reduction</h2>
                <p>Harm reduction is a public health approach that focuses on reducing the negative effects associated with substance use. Rather than promoting abstinence as the only goal, harm reduction acknowledges that people use substances and aims to minimize the potential harm caused by that use.</p>
                <p>Harm reduction strategies are evidence-based interventions designed to reduce drug-related harm without necessarily requiring abstinence from drug use. These strategies include health services and community outreach programs.</p>

                <h2>Why Harm Reduction Matters</h2>
                <p>The opioid crisis has claimed hundreds of thousands of lives. Harm reduction recognizes that:</p>
                <ul style="line-height: 2; color: var(--light-text);">
                    <li>People who use drugs are members of our community deserving of compassion and support</li>
                    <li>Overdose is preventable with access to the right tools and resources</li>
                    <li>Addressing substance use requires multiple approaches, not just abstinence-based treatment</li>
                    <li>Stigma and criminalization increase harm and prevent people from seeking help</li>
